# Spider-Verse Website

This is a simple **Spider-Man themed webpage** I built using **HTML and CSS**.  
The site features:
- A **full-screen fixed Spider-Man background image** (`N2 Spider.png`)  
- **Frosted glass effect** (glassmorphism) on all text, so itâ€™s easy to read  
- Text automatically **sizes its background** to fit, with smooth styling  
- **Responsive design** that works on laptops, desktops, and 4K screens

I also experimented with:
- Positioning content using **Flexbox** (`align-items` and `justify-content`)  
  - Top-left, Bottom-right, and Center layouts  
- Preparing the site to be **hosted online** with **GitHub Pages**
